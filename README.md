### Project Description
Sortshot is an intelligent screenshot organization tool powered by AI assistance that helps you automatically categorize, rename, and organize screenshots into custom folders like tickets, chats, funny, movie, and more. Built with Python and enhanced by AI-generated components for smarter file management.

### The Problem statement
People accumulate hundreds of screenshots on their devices but struggle to organize them efficiently. Manually renaming and categorizing screenshots is time-consuming, inconsistent, and prone to errors.

### The Solution
Sortshot combines a user-friendly interface with AI-enhanced development to provide:
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Leveraged AI tools to create robust file handling, intelligent error management, and optimized code structure
- **Smart Categorization**: Visual interface to batch-process screenshots with automatic numbering
- **Intelligent Organization**: Automatically creates category-specific folders and maintains naming consistency
- **Adaptive Learning**: Remembers your last used categories and maintains sequential numbering across sessions
